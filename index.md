## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Lets get you started with dark hub ui.
### Importing the ui
This is not my fault if you get introuble using this well intresting ui 

Lets start by importing the ui by doing
```Importing the ui
local lib = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomAdamYT/DarkHub/master/NewUI"))()
main = lib:Window()
```
So far this will only show a window because we haven added any buttons or tabs. So lets add some!
### Adding a ui

lets add a tab to start
```markdown
Hewwo = main:Tab('Welcome')
```
